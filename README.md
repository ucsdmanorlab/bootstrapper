A toolkit for bootstrapping and refining 3D instance segmentations and models from sparse 2D labels. 

- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI**: Command-line interface for training, prediction, post-processing
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Models**: Flexible and hackable models using config files
- üß± **Blockwise Processing**: Efficient handling of large volumes

## Installation

To install `bootstrapper`, we first recommend creating a new conda environment:
```
conda create -n bs -c conda-forge python=3.12 graph-tool boost
conda activate bs
```
Then, install bootstrapper with:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ucsdmanorlab/bootstrapper.git
```

## Getting Started

Bootstrapper has the following commands, typically run in the given order:
- `bs prepare` : Prepare data and config files for the following steps

- `bs train` : Train a model

- `bs predict` : Run inference on a volume

- `bs segment` : Segment affinities

- `bs evaluate` : Evaluate segmentations against ground truth or model predictions

- `bs filter` : Refine segmentations to create pseudo-ground truth

A **round** is a cycle of the above commands.
- Use `bs prepare` to create config files for one or multiple rounds.
- Refined segmentations from one round become training labels for the next round.

It also has:

- `bs run`: Runs the appropriate command for the given config file.
- `bs view` : A wrapper for `neuroglancer -d`
- `bs utils` offers functions for data manipulation and preprocessing.
